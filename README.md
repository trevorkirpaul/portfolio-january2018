### Portfolio January 2018

This is a simple redesign of a portfolio site. It resembles a console window in linux and has 2 'easter egg' console commands.

On mobile screens (less than 450px width) the window buttons and console input are diabled to save space. This is really a design that only functions completely on a desktop or table screen but the point is still clear on mobile.

Feel free to use this design, if requested I'll make a template.
